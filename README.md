# Simple Ktor example

Very simple project to show Ktor client and server.
The client example calls The Movie Database's open example endpoint, which fetches a Star Wars movie. TMDB is a great resource for APIs but I wanted to keep it simple.
This is found on localhost:8080/tmdb

The server example shows some simple routing and usage of Ktor's html dsl for playing Lucy roulette :3 
This is found on localhost:8080/Lucy

I added Nat Pryce's Konfig library because it's great for injecting environment specific values
I didn't add any tests, because I am lazy and I want to watch Critical Role instead

# What do?
have intellij
press big play button
go to url 
play Lucy roulette!!
